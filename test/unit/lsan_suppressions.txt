# LeakSanitizer suppressions for third-party libraries.
# These are known leaks in MPI/hwloc/libCEED internals, not Palace code.
# See https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html#suppressing-memory-leaks

# OpenMPI / PRRTE runtime (MPI_Init, event loop, hardware topology)
leak:libopen-rte
leak:libmpi
leak:libhwloc
leak:libopen-pal
leak:libevent

# libCEED backend initialization
leak:CeedStringAllocCopy
leak:libceed

# MFEM (NCMesh element allocations not freed at shutdown)
leak:libmfem

# OpenMPI internal strdup calls (no debug symbols, shows as <unknown module>)
leak:strdup

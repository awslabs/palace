To demonstrate this feature, we consider here the propagation of an electromagnetic pulse through a section of coaxial cable. The model is constructed based on a 50text Omega RG-401/U coaxial cable [1], with outer and inner conductor diameters of 0215text in and 00645text in, respectively. The section length is roughly 15text in. The Teflon dielectric material has varepsilon_r = 208, and we consider tandelta = 4times 10^-2, a factor of 100 above the actual value in order to exaggerate losses in the transmission line.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/coaxial/","page":"Signal Propagation in a Coaxial Cable","title":"Signal Propagation in a Coaxial Cable","text":"In this example we consider three different configurations of the model, all with a coaxial lumped port excitation at one end of the line: an open termination at the opposite end (coaxial_open.json), a shorted termination(coaxial_short.json), and a matched 50text Omega lumped port termination (coaxial_matched.json).","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/coaxial/","page":"Signal Propagation in a Coaxial Cable","title":"Signal Propagation in a Coaxial Cable","text":"The mesh is generated using the Julia code in mesh/mesh.jl and consists of quadratically-curved hexahedral elements, as depicted below.

# Inductance Matrix for a Pair of Concentric Rings

!!! note
    
    The files for this example can be found in the [`examples/rings/`]
    (https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/rings) directory of the *Palace*
    source code.

This example seeks to compute the inductance matrix for a system of two concentric
current-carrying rings of radii ``r_a`` and ``r_b``, each with width ``w``. As for the
previous example, the permeability of the surrounding medium is assumed to be the
permeability of free space. The mutual inductance, ``M_{ab}``, can be easily computed for
the case where ``r_a\ll r_b`` and ``w = 0`` using the Biot-Savart law as

```math
M_{ab} = \frac{\mu_0\pi r_b^2}{2 r_a} \,.
```

Analytic expressions for the self inductance of this configuration can also be derived, for
example from [[1]](#References) we have

```math
\begin{aligned}
M_{aa} &= \mu_0 r_a \left(\log{\frac{16 r_a}{w}}-1.75\right) \\
M_{bb} &= \mu_0 r_b \left(\log{\frac{16 r_b}{w}}-1.75\right) \,.
\end{aligned}
```

We take in this case ``r_a = 10 \text{ μm}``, ``r_b = 100 \text{ μm}``, and
``w = 1 \text{ μm}``. The `mesh.jl` script in the [`mesh/`]
(https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/rings/mesh) directory is used to
generate an unstructured tetrahedral mesh with Gmsh, saved to [`mesh/rings.msh`]
(https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/rings/mesh/rings.msh), and a depiction
is shown below.

The configuration file for the *Palace* simulation is [`rings.json`]
(https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/rings/rings.json). The simulation
`"Type"` is `"Magnetostatic"`, and we add `"SurfaceCurrent"` boundaries for applying a
surface current to drive the inner or outer ring. The rest of the ring boundaries are
labeled as `"PEC"` boundaries, which prescibes a zero magnetic flux, or magnetic
insulation, boundary condition. The farfield is also prescribed the `"PEC"` boundary
condition. We seek a second-order solution and use the geometric multigrid AMS
solver.

The computed inductance matrix is saved to disk as `postpro/terminal-M.csv`, and below we
show its contents:

```
            i,             M[i][1] (H),             M[i][2] (H)
 1.000000e+00,        +4.272291158e-11,        +1.959927760e-12
 2.000000e+00,        +1.959927760e-12,        +7.131293160e-10
```

According to the analytic expressions above, for this geometry we should have

```math
M_{ab} = 1.973921\text{ pH}
```

for the mutual inductance, and

```math
\begin{aligned}
M_{aa} &= 41.78537\text{ pH}\\
M_{bb} &= 707.2050\text{ pH}
\end{aligned}
```

for the self inductances. Thus, the *Palace* solution has approximately ``0.71\%`` error in
the mutual inductance and ``2.2\%`` and ``0.84\%`` errors in the self inductances versus the
analytic solutions.

The typical approach used by *Palace* for lumped parameter extraction uses the computed
field energies, but one can also compute the inductance by explicitly integrating the
magnetic flux through a surface and dividing by the excitation current. This is configured
under [`config["Boundaries"]["Postprocessing"]["Inductance"]`]
(../config/boundaries.md#boundaries["Postprocessing"]["Inductance"]) in the configuration
file. The resulting postprocessed values are written to `postpro/surface-M.csv`:

```
            i,                M[1] (H),                M[2] (H)
 1.000000e+00,        +4.260888637e-11,        +1.890068391e-12
 2.000000e+00,        +1.955578068e-12,        +7.130510941e-10
```

The values computed using the flux integral method are in close agreement to those above, as
expected.

Lastly, we visualize the magnitude of the magnetic flux density field for the excitations of
the inner and outer rings. The files for this visualization are again saved to the
`postpro/paraview` directory.

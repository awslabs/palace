# Dipole Antenna and Radiation Fields

!!! note
    
    The files for this example can be found in the
    [`examples/antenna/`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/antenna)
    directory of the *Palace* source code. In this example, we increased the number of sampling points from 100 to 86400.

In this example, we study a half-wave dipole antenna and analyze its radiation
characteristics. The dipole antenna is one of the most fundamental antenna
types, consisting of two conducting elements of length ``L`` fed at the center
by a sinusoidal excitation.

For an infinitely thin half-wave dipole, the problem can be solved analytically
and the solution serves as our reference for validation [[1]](#References). In
the wave-zone, the operating wavelength in free space ``\lambda`` is twice the
total length of the antenna (``\lambda = 2 \times 2L = 4L``). The normalized
field pattern on the E-plane (xz-plane) is given by

```math
E(\theta) = \left|\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\cos\theta\right)}{\sin\theta}\right|\,,
```

while the pattern is isotropic on the H-plane (xy-plane).

We will model a dipole antenna with arm length ``L`` and finite radius ``a``,
solve a driven problem at the resonant frequency ``\lambda = 4L`` and extract
the radiation pattern ``P(\theta)`` with *Palace*'s [far-field extraction
capabilities](../features/farfield.md#Extracting-Fields-in-the-Radiation-Zone)).

## Problem Setup

The dipole is modeled as two thin infinitely conductive cylindrical wires with
length ``L = 1\text{ m}`` and radius ``a = L/20 = 5\text{ cm}``, separated by a
thin cylindrical gap of height ``h = L/100 = 1\text{ cm}``. Given these
geometrical characteristics, the operating wavelength is approximately ``\lambda = 4\text{ m}``, corresponding to a frequency of ``\nu = c / \lambda = 0.0749\text{ GHz}``.

The gap serves as the excitation point for the antenna. Rather than explicitly
modeling the feeding circuit, we place a flat rectangular strip on the xz-plane
that connects the two arms of the antenna. This strip functions as a
lumped port to excite the system.

The surrounding medium is free space. In reality, electromagnetic waves would
propagate freely to infinity. We model this by enclosing the antenna in a sphere
of radius ``r_{max} = 1.5\lambda = 6\text{ m}`` centered at the origin and
applying appropriate boundary conditions to simulate the infinite domain.

The mesh is generated using [`Gmsh`](https://gmsh.info) and consists of
tetrahedral elements with appropriate refinement near the antenna structure. The
element size increases with distance from the antenna, but is capped to ensure
the wavelength is resolved by at least a few elements per wavelength. The mesh
file is
[`mesh/antenna.msh`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/antenna/mesh/antenna.msh)
and is generated using the Julia script
[`mesh/mesh.jl`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/antenna/mesh/mesh.jl).

A visualization of the model and the resulting mesh is shown below.

```

The left image shows the outer domain and the inner antenna structure. The right
image provides a close-up view of the gap region, where the rectangular port is
aligned on the xz-plane and spans the diameter of the cylindrical conductors.

## Configuration File

The configuration file for the *Palace* simulation is found in
[`antenna.json`](https://github.com/awslabs/palace/blob/main/examples/antenna/antenna.json).
The simulation is performed in the frequency domain using the `"Driven"` solver
type, operating at a single frequency of ``0.0749\text{ GHz}``.

Since we assume the metallic rods are perfect conductors, we impose perfect
electric conductor (PEC) boundary conditions on their surfaces. To prevent
reflections of electromagnetic waves back into the computational domain, we
apply `"Absorbing"` boundary conditions on the outer spherical boundary.

The antenna is driven using the rectangular strip as a lumped port. This port
lies entirely in the xz-plane, and by setting `"Direction": "+Z"` and
`"Excitation": true`, we impose an electric field aligned in the z-direction
across the gap.

We use the [far-field extraction
feature](../features/farfield.md#Extracting-Fields-in-the-Radiation-Zone) in
*Palace* to extract electric fields at infinity. To do so, we add a
`"PostProcessing"` section under `"Boundaries"` with the same `Attributes` as
the surface with `"Absorbing"` boundary conditions and we choose a positive
value for `"NSample"`. A `NSample` of `64800` means that the far-field sphere is
uniformly discretized with resolution of one degree on the equator (to preserve
the uniform distribution, the resolution changes as one moves towards the
poles).

!!! tip "ComplexCoarseSolve solver optimization"
    
    This simulation benefits from the `"ComplexCoarseSolve"` option. This
    setting uses a complex preconditioner of the form `P = [Ar, -Ai; Ai, Ar]` rather than
    the default `P = Ar + Ai`, where `A` is the true system matrix with
    real and imaginary  parts `Ar` and `Ai`. While the resulting system is four times larger, it
    preserves the coupling between real and imaginary parts which can be significant
    for problems with strong imaginary components. For this particular problem, this
    approach accelerates convergence by several factors, though at the cost of increased
    memory usage.

## Analysis and Results

The simulation requires approximately 6 GBs of RAM and completes in a few
minutes (depending on the hardware). The simulation produces a 160 MB `postpro`
folder, which contains the electromagnetic fields that we will use to extract
radiation patterns.

First, let us look at the far-field output. The `postpro` folder contains a
file, `farfield-rE.csv`, with the far-field electric fields for the all the
target frequencies (in this case, only `7.49000000e-02` GHz). The first few
lines of this file are:

```@example include_example
include_example_file("antenna", "farfield-rE.csv") #hide
```

The `plot_farfield.jl` Julia script processes this file and produces plots polar
for the E- and H- planes (xz/xy-planes) and in the 3D.

```bash
julia --project plot_radiation_pattern.jl postpro/farfield-rE.csv
```

The results for the polar plot are shown below.

```@raw html

  <img src="../../assets/examples/antenna-3.png" width="100%" />
</p><br/>
```

On the H-plane, we see the expected isotropic emission pattern for any of the
extracted radii. On the E-plane, we see agreement with the characteristic
figure-eight pattern of a dipole antenna, with maximum radiation perpendicular
to the antenna axis and nulls approximately along the antenna axis.

!!! note "Do your results look different?"
    
    If you are trying to reproduce this plot, but find that your plots are not as nice
    as the one above, you might have a missed a note at the top of this page: the example
    was run with 64800 sampling points instead of the 100 that the JSON file specifies.
    Change `NSample` to 64800 and run your simulation again.

We can see the same pattern rendered in 3D as well

```@raw html
<br/><p align="center">
  <img src="../../assets/examples/antenna-4.png" width="80%" />
</p><br/>
```

This plot shows the 3D relative antenna pattern representing the normalized
strength of the electric field as function of the distance from the origin. Once
again, we see the expected donut shape, with maximal electric field strength on
the equator, and minimum along the z axis.

!!! note "Running the Julia script"
    
    The `plot_radiation_pattern.jl` requires a number of Julia packages (including
    the plotting library). The simplest way to ensure that you have all the required
    packages is to use the `Project.toml` included with the examples. To install this
    environment, navigate to the `examples` folder and run
    
    ```bash
    julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate();'
    ```
    
    All the subsequent times, just make sure to start Julia with `--project` from the `examples`
    
    folder or one of its subfolders.

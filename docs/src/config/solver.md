    "Linear":
    {

    }
}
```

with

`"Order" [1]` :  Finite element order (degree). Arbitrary high-order spaces are supported.

`"PartialAssemblyOrder" [1]` :  Order at which to switch from full assembly of finite
element operators to [partial assembly](https://mfem.org/howto/assembly_levels/). Setting
this parameter equal to 1 will fully activate operator partial assembly on all levels, while
setting it to some large number (greater than the finite element order) will result in
fully assembled operators as sparse matrices.

`"Device" ["CPU"]` :  The runtime device configuration passed to
[MFEM](https://mfem.org/howto/assembly_levels/) in order to activate different options
specified during configuration. The available options are:

  - `"CPU"`
  - `"GPU"`
  - `"Debug"`

The `"GPU"` option will automatically activate the `cuda` or `hip` device based on whether
MFEM is built with CUDA (`MFEM_USE_CUDA=ON`) or HIP (`MFEM_USE_HIP=ON`) support. When
*Palace* is built with OpenMP support (`PALACE_WITH_OPENMP=ON`), `omp` is automatically
added to the list of activated MFEM devices. The `"Debug"` option for MFEM's `debug` device
is useful for debugging issues associated with GPU-based runs of *Palace*.

`"Backend" [""]` :  Specifies the
[libCEED backend](https://libceed.org/en/latest/gettingstarted/#backends) to use for the
simulation. If no backend is specified, a suitable default backend is selected based on the
given `config["Solver"]["Device"]`.

`"Eigenmode"` :  Top-level object for configuring the eigenvalue solver for the eigenmode
simulation type. Thus, this object is only relevant for
[`config["Problem"]["Type"]: "Eigenmode"`](problem.md#config%5B%22Problem%22%5D).

`"Driven"` :  Top-level object for configuring the frequency domain driven simulation type.
Thus, this object is only relevant for
[`config["Problem"]["Type"]: "Driven"`](problem.md#config%5B%22Problem%22%5D).

`"Transient"` :  Top-level object for configuring the time domain driven simulation type.
Thus, this object is only relevant for
[`config["Problem"]["Type"]: "Transient"`](problem.md#config%5B%22Problem%22%5D).

`"Electrostatic"` :  Top-level object for configuring the electrostatic simulation type.
Thus, this object is only relevant for
[`config["Problem"]["Type"]: "Electrostatic"`](problem.md#config%5B%22Problem%22%5D).

`"Magnetostatic"` :  Top-level object for configuring the magnetostatic simulation type.
Thus, this object is only relevant for
[`config["Problem"]["Type"]: "Magnetostatic"`](problem.md#config%5B%22Problem%22%5D).

`"Linear"` :  Top-level object for configuring the linear solver employed by all simulation
types.

`"Samples" [None]` : Array of [sample
specifications](solver.md#solver%5B%22Driven%22%5D%5B%22Samples%22%5D) that specify how to

`"MinFreq"`, `"MaxFreq"`, `"FreqStep"` and `"SaveStep"`. See
[`solver["Driven"]["Samples"]`](solver.md#solver%5B%22Driven%22%5D%5B%22Samples%22%5D) for

`"AdaptiveTol" [0.0]` :  Relative error convergence tolerance for adaptive frequency sweep.
If zero, adaptive frequency sweep is disabled and the full-order model is solved at each
frequency step in the specified interval. If positive, this tolerance is used to ensure the
reliability of the reduced-order model relative to the full-order one in the frequency band
of interest.

`"AdaptiveMaxSamples" [20]` :  Maximum number of frequency samples used to construct the
reduced-order model for adaptive fast frequency sweep, if the specified tolerance (`"AdaptiveTol"`)
is not met first. In simulations with multiple excitations, this is the maximum number of samples
per excitation.

`"AdaptiveConvergenceMemory" [2]` :  Memory used for assessing convergence of the adaptive
sampling algorithm for constructing the reduced-order model for adaptive fast frequency
sweep. For example, a memory of "2" requires two consecutive samples which satisfy the
error tolerance.

Files are saved in the `paraview/` directory under the directory specified by
[`config["Problem"]["Output"]`](problem.md#config%5B%22Problem%22%5D).

`"AddToPROM" [false]` : Advanced option to force the inclusion of this sample into the PROM
when performing an adaptive sweep. This is primarily a debugging tool as the error
estimation procedure will in general make more efficient selections of sampling points, and
using this mechanism can result in a significantly larger and less efficient PROM.

complex-valued system matrix. When set to `false`, the real-valued approximation is used.

`"PCSide" ["Default"]` :  Side for preconditioning. Not all options are available for all
iterative solver choices, and the default choice depends on the iterative solver used.

  - `"Right"`
  - `"Default"`

## Mathematical background

The solver computes a finite element approximation to the three-dimensional, time-harmonic
Maxwell's equations in second-order form. The nondimensionalized, source-free, boundary
value problem for ``\bm{E}(\bm{x})\in\mathbb{C}^3``, ``\bm{x}\in\Omega``,
``\partial\Omega = \Gamma``, where
``\bm{\mathscr{E}}(\bm{x},t) = \text{Re}\{\bm{E}(\bm{x})e^{i\omega t}\}`` denotes the
electric field, is written as

```math
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\times\mu_r^{-1}\nabla\times\bm{E} + i\omega\sigma\bm{E}
    - \omega^2\varepsilon_r\bm{E} &= 0 \,,\; \bm{x}\in\Omega \\
\bm{n}\times\bm{E} &= 0 \,,\; \bm{x}\in\Gamma_{PEC} \\
\bm{n}\times(\mu_r^{-1}\nabla\times\bm{E}) &= 0 \,,\; \bm{x}\in\Gamma_{PMC} \\
\bm{n}\times(\mu_r^{-1}\nabla\times\bm{E})
    + \gamma\bm{n}\times(\bm{n}\times\bm{E}) &= \bm{U}^{inc} \,,\; \bm{x}\in\Gamma_{Z}
\end{aligned}
```

where the nondimensionalization has been performed with respect to a characteristic length
``L_0``, time ``L_0/c_0``, magnetic field strength ``H_0``, and electric field strength
``Z_0 H_0``. Here, ``c_0`` and ``Z_0`` are the speed of light and impedance of free space,
respectively. This nondimensionalization will be used throughout this entire reference. For
more details, see [[1]](#References) and [[2]](#References).

Given the electric field solution, the time-harmonic magnetic flux density can be calculated
as

```math
\bm{B} = -\frac{1}{i\omega}\nabla\times\bm{E} \,.
```

The flux density is related to the magnetic field, ``\bm{H}``, by the standard linear
constitutive relationship ``\bm{H} = \mu_r^{-1}\bm{B}``.

In general, the material property coefficients may be scalar- or matrix-valued. In the
matrix-valued (anisotropic) case, the material property coefficients should still always be
symmetric.

For a general isotropic lossy dielectric, the relative permittivity ``\varepsilon_r`` is a
complex-valued quantity:

```math
\varepsilon_r = \varepsilon_r' (1-i\tan{\delta})
```

where ``\varepsilon_r'`` is the real relative permittivity and ``\tan{\delta}`` is the loss
tangent. Alternatively, conductor loss is modeled by Ohm's law ``\bm{J} = \sigma\bm{E}``
with electrical conductivity ``\sigma > 0.0``. For a superconducting domain, the constitive
current-field relationship given by Ohm's law is replaced by that given by the London
equations:

```math
\frac{\partial \bm{J}}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{\mu_r\lambda_L^2}\bm{E}
```

where ``\lambda_L = \sqrt{m/\mu n_s e^2}/L_0`` is the nondimensionalized London penetration
depth. In this case, the term ``+i\omega\sigma \bm{E}`` arising for a normal conductor in
the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations becomes ``+(\mu_r \lambda_L^2)^{-1}\bm{E}``.

The domain boundary ``\Gamma = \Gamma_{PEC}\cup\Gamma_{PMC}\cup\Gamma_{Z}``, is separated
into perfect electric conductor (PEC), perfect magnetic conductor (PMC), and impedance
boundaries, respectively. The PEC boundary condition is a homogeneous Dirichlet condition,
while the PMC boundary condition is the natural boundary condition for the problem and is
satisfied at all exterior boundaries by the finite element formulation. Impedance
boundaries are modeled using a Robin boundary condition with ``\gamma = i\omega/Z_s``, in
which ``Z_s`` the surface impedance of the boundary, with units of impedance per square.

## Time domain formulation

A time-dependent formulation is also available to compute the electric field response
``\bm{E}(\bm{x},t)`` for a given time-dependent source excitation
``\bm{U}^{inc}(\bm{x},t)``. The governing equations in this case are

```math
\nabla\times\mu_r^{-1}\nabla\times\bm{E} + \sigma\frac{\partial\bm{E}}{\partial t}
    + \varepsilon_r\frac{\partial^2\bm{E}}{\partial t^2} = 0 \,,\; \bm{x}\in\Omega
```

subject to the same boundary conditions as the frequency-dependent case except for the Robin
boundary condition which is written for a lumped resistive port boundary, for example, as

```math
\bm{n}\times(\mu_r^{-1}\nabla\times\bm{E})
    + Z_s^{-1}\bm{n}\times\left(\bm{n}\times\frac{\partial\bm{E}}{\partial t}\right)
    = \bm{U}^{inc} \,,\; \bm{x}\in\Gamma_{Z} \,.
```

The second-order electric field differential equation is transformed into a first-order
ODE system which is solved along with the equation for the magnetic flux density

```math
\left(\begin{matrix} \varepsilon_r & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & I & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & I\end{matrix}\right)
  \left(\begin{matrix} \ddot{\bm{E}} \\ \dot{\bm{E}} \\ \dot{\bm{B}}\end{matrix} \right)
  = \left(\begin{matrix} -\sigma & -\nabla\times\mu_r^{-1}\nabla\times & 0\\ I & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -\nabla\times & 0\end{matrix}\right)
    \left(\begin{matrix}\dot{\bm{E}}\\ \bm{E} \\ \bm{B} \end{matrix}\right) \,.
```

The first-order ODE system formulation is chosen to take advantage of implicit adaptive
time-stepping integration schemes. The ``3 \times 3`` system can be block-eliminated to
avoid an expensive coupled block system solve. It offers the additional benefit
of sharing many similarities in the spatial discretization as the frequency domain
formulation outlined above.

## Eigenmode calculations

For eigenmode problems, the source term is zero and a quadratic eigenvalue problem for the
eigenvalues ``\omega`` is solved:

```math
(\bm{K}+i\omega\bm{C}-\omega^2\bm{M})\bm{x} = 0
```

where the matrix ``\bm{K}`` represents the discretized curl-curl operator, ``\bm{M}`` the
mass term, and ``\bm{C}`` the port impedance boundary conditions. The damped frequency
``\omega_d`` and quality factor ``Q`` are postprocessed from each of the resulting
eigenvalues as

```math
\omega_d = \text{Re}\{\omega\} \,, \qquad Q = \frac{|\omega|}{2|\text{Im}\{\omega\}|} \,.
```

The eigenmodes are normalized such that they have unit norm and their mean phase is a positive real number.

## Lumped ports and wave ports

For lumped port boundaries, the surface impedance can be related to an equivalent circuit
impedance, ``Z``. There are two common cases:

 1. *Rectangular ports*: ``Z = Z_s l / w``, where ``l`` and ``w`` are the length and width
    of the port, respectively (length here is defined as the distance between the two
    conductors).

 2. *Coaxial ports*: ``Z = Z_s \ln(b/a) / 2\pi``, where ``a`` and ``b`` denote the inner and
    outer radii of the port, respectively.

A lumped parallel RLC circuit boundary has a circuit impedance

```math
\frac{1}{Z} = \frac{1}{R}+\frac{1}{i\omega L}+i\omega C \,.
```

Thus, the relationships between the circuit and surface element parameters for the user to
specify are given by ``R_s = \alpha R``, ``L_s = \alpha L``, and ``C_s = C/\alpha``, where
``\alpha = w/l`` for a rectangular port or ``\alpha = 2\pi / \ln(b/a)`` for a coaxial
port.

For multielement lumped ports, the effective circuit impedance is given by

```math
\frac{1}{Z} = \sum_k \frac{1}{Z_k} \,.
```

That is, the circuit impedances of each port contributing to the multielement port add in
parallel. For the specific case of a two element multielement port with two identical
lumped elements, we have ``Z = (1/Z_1 + 1/Z_2)^{-1} = Z_k / 2``, where ``Z_k`` is the
circuit impedance of a single port element.

The source term ``\bm{U}^{inc}`` in a driven frequency-response problem is related to the
incident field at an excited port boundary by

```math
\bm{U}^{inc} = -2\gamma(\bm{n}\times\bm{E}^{inc})\times\bm{n}
```

where ``(\bm{n}\times\bm{E}^{inc})\times\bm{n}`` is just the projection of the excitation
field onto the port surface. The incident fields for lumped ports depend on the port
shape:

 1. *Rectangular ports*: ``\bm{E}^{inc} = E_0 \, \hat{\bm{l}}``, where ``E_0`` is a uniform
    constant field strength and ``\hat{\bm{l}}`` a unit vector defining the direction of
    polarization on the port (typically should be the direction between the two conductors).

 2. *Coaxial ports*: ``\bm{E}^{inc} = \frac{E_0 r_0}{r} \, \hat{\bm{r}}``, where ``E_0`` is
    again a uniform constant field strength, ``r_0`` is a characteristic length for the
    port, ``r`` is the distance from the port center, and ``\hat{\bm{r}}`` a unit vector
    specifying the port radial direction.

In the time domain formulation, the source term ``\bm{U}^{inc}`` appears as

```math
\bm{U}^{inc} = -2 Z_s^{-1}\left(\bm{n}\times\frac{\partial\bm{E}^{inc}}{\partial t}\right)
    \times\bm{n} \,.
```

The incident field ``\bm{E}^{inc}(\bm{x},t)`` is

```math
\bm{E}^{inc}(\bm{x},t) = p(t)\bm{E}^{inc}(\bm{x})
```

where ``\bm{E}^{inc}(\bm{x})`` is identical to the spatial excitation in the frequency
domain formulation, and ``p(t)`` describes the temporal shape of the excitation. Possible
options include a sinusoidal, Gaussian, modulated Gaussian, or step excitation.

In the frequency domain, the scattering parameters can be postprocessed from the computed
electric field for each lumped port with boundary ``\Gamma_i`` as

```math
S_{ij} = \frac{\displaystyle\int_{\Gamma_i}\bm{E}\cdot\bm{E}^{inc}_i\,dS}
    {\displaystyle\int_{\Gamma_i}\bm{E}^{inc}_i\cdot\bm{E}^{inc}_i\,dS} - \delta_{ij} \,.
```

In the time domain, the time histories of the port voltages can be Fourier-transformed to
get their frequency domain representation for scattering parameter calculation.

Numeric wave ports assume a field with known normal-direction dependence
``\bm{E}(\bm{x}) = \bm{e}(\bm{x}_t)e^{ik_n x_n}`` where ``k_n`` is the propagation constant.
For each operating frequency ``\omega``, a two-dimensional eigenvalue problem is solved on
the port yielding the mode shapes ``\bm{e}_m`` and associated propagation constants
``k_{n,m}``. These are used in the full 3D model where the Robin port boundary condition has
coefficient ``\gamma = i\text{Re}\{k_{n,m}\}/\mu_r`` and the computed mode is used to
compute the incident field in the source term ``\bm{U}^{inc}`` at excited ports. Scattering
parameter postprocessing takes the same form as the lumped port counterpart using the
computed modal solutions. Since the propagation constants are known for each wave port,
scattering parameter de-embedding can be performed by specifying an offset distance ``d``
for each port:

```math
\tilde{S}_{ij} = S_{ij}e^{ik_{n,i}d_i}e^{ik_{n,j}d_j} \,.
```

For more information on the implementation of numeric wave ports, see [[3]](#References).

## Other boundary conditions

The first-order absorbing boundary condition, also referred to as a scattering boundary
condition, is a special case of the general impedance boundary condition described above:

```math
\bm{n}\times(\mu_r^{-1}\nabla\times\bm{E})
    + i\omega\sqrt{\mu_r^{-1}\varepsilon_r}\bm{n}\times(\bm{n}\times\bm{E}) = 0 \,.
```

This is also known as the Sommerfeld radiation condition, and one can recognize the
dependence on the impedance of free space ``Z_0^{-1} = \sqrt{\mu_r^{-1}\varepsilon_r}``. The
second-order absorbing boundary condition is

```math
\bm{n}\times(\mu_r^{-1}\nabla\times\bm{E})
    + i\omega\sqrt{\mu_r^{-1}\varepsilon_r}\bm{n}\times(\bm{n}\times\bm{E})
    - \beta\nabla\times[(\nabla\times\bm{E})_n\bm{n}] = 0
```

where assuming an infinite radius of curvature ``\beta = \mu_r^{-1}c_0/(2i\omega)``, and the
contribution depending on ``(\nabla\cdot\bm{E}_t)`` has been neglected.

Additionally, while metals with finite conductivity can be modeled using an impedance
boundary condition with constant impedance ``Z_s``, a more accurate model taking into
account the frequency dependence of the skin depth is

```math
Z_s = \frac{1+i}{\delta\sigma}
```

where ``\delta = \sqrt{2/\mu_r\sigma\omega}`` is the skin depth and ``\sigma`` is the
conductivity of the metal. Another model, which takes into account finite thickness effects,
is given by

```math
Z_s = \frac{1}{\delta\sigma}\left(\frac{\sinh{\nu}+\sin{\nu}}{\cosh{\nu}+\cos{\nu}}
    + i\frac{\sinh{\nu}-\sin{\nu}}{\cosh{\nu}+\cos{\nu}}\right)
```

where ``\nu = h/\delta`` and ``h`` is the layer thickness. This model correctly produces the
DC limit when ``h\ll\delta``.

## Energy-participation ratios

The energy-participation ratio (EPR) for lumped inductive elements is computed from the
electric and magnetic fields corresponding to eigenmode ``m``, ``\bm{E}_m`` and
``\bm{H}_m``, using the formula

```math
p_{mj} = \frac{1}{\mathcal{E}^{elec}_m} \, \frac{1}{2} \, L_j I_{mj}^2
```

where ``p_{mj}\in[-1,1]`` denotes the signed participation ratio for junction ``j`` in mode
``m``, ``L_j`` is the provided junction circuit inductance, ``I_ {mj}`` is the peak
junction current for mode ``m``, and ``\mathcal{E}^{elec}_m`` is the electric energy in
mode ``m``. The junction current is computed using the mean voltage across the port,
``\overline{V}_{mj}``, as ``I_{mj} = \overline{V}_{mj}/Z_{mj}``, where
``Z_{mj} = 1/(i\omega_m L_j)`` is the impedance of the inductive branch of the lumped
circuit. The mean port voltage depends on the computed electric field mode and the shape of
the port:

 1. *Rectangular ports*:
    ``\overline{V}_{mj} = \frac{1}{w_j}\int_{\Gamma_j}\bm{E}_m\cdot\hat{\bm{l}}_j\,dS``.

 2. *Coaxial ports*:
    ``\overline{V}_{mj} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\Gamma_j}\frac{\bm{E}_m}{r}\cdot\hat{\bm{r}}_j\,dS``.

Finally, the total electric energy in mode ``m`` is

```math
\mathcal{E}^{elec}_m
    = \frac{1}{2} \, \text{Re}\left\{\int_\Omega\bm{D}_m^*\cdot\bm{E}_m\,dV\right\}
    + \sum_j \frac{1}{2} \, C_jV_{mj}^2
```

where ``\bm{D}_m = \varepsilon_r\bm{E}_m`` is the electric flux density for mode ``m`` and
the second term on the right-hand side accounts for any lumped capacitive boundaries with
nonzero circuit capacitance ``C_j``.

The EPR can also be used to estimate mode quality factors due to input-output (I-O) line
coupling. The mode coupling quality factor due to the ``j``-th I-O port is given by

```math
Q_{mj} = \frac{\omega_m}{\kappa_{mj}}
```

where the port coupling rate ``\kappa_{mj}`` is calculated as

```math
\kappa_{mj} = \frac{1}{\mathcal{E}^{elec}_m} \, \frac{1}{2}\,R_j I_{mj}^2 \,.
```

## Bulk and interface dielectric loss

The quality factor due to bulk dielectric loss resulting from an electric field ``\bm{E}``
present in domain ``j`` with associated loss tangent ``\tan{\delta}_j`` is given by

```math
\frac{1}{Q_j} = p_j \tan{\delta}_j =
    \frac{1}{\mathcal{E}^{elec}} \, \frac{1}{2} \, \tan{\delta}_j \,
    \text{Re}\left\{\int_{\Omega_j}\bm{D}^*\cdot\bm{E}\,dV\right\}
```

where, as above, ``\mathcal{E}^{elec}`` is the total electric field energy in the domain,
including the contributions due to capacitive lumped elements.

Likewise, the quality factor due to surface interface dielectric loss for interface ``j`` is
given by

```math
\frac{1}{Q_j} = p_j \tan{\delta}_j =
    \frac{1}{\mathcal{E}^{elec}} \, \frac{1}{2} \, t_j\tan{\delta}_j \,
    \text{Re}\left\{\int_{\Gamma_j}\bm{D}^*\cdot\bm{E}\,dS\right\}
```

where ``t_j`` is the thickness of the layer and ``\bm{D} = \varepsilon_{r,j}\bm{E}`` is the
electric displacement field in the layer evaluated using the relative permittivity of the
interface ``\varepsilon_{r,j}``. For an internal boundary, this integral is evaluated on a
single side to resolve abiguity due to the discontinuity of ``\bm{E}`` across the boundary.

The above formula for interface dielectric loss can be specialized for the case of a
metal-air, metal-substrate, or substrate-air interface [[4]](#References). In each case, the
quality factor for interface ``j`` is given by

  - *Metal-air*:

```math
\frac{1}{Q^{MA}_j} =
    \frac{1}{\mathcal{E}^{elec}} \, \frac{1}{2} \,
    \frac{t_j\tan{\delta}_j}{\varepsilon_{r,j}^{MA}} \,
    \text{Re}\left\{\int_{\Gamma_j}\bm{E}_n^*\cdot\bm{E}_n\,dS\right\}
```

  - *Metal-substrate*:

```math
\frac{1}{Q^{MS}_j} =
    \frac{1}{\mathcal{E}^{elec}} \, \frac{1}{2} \,
    \frac{t_j\tan{\delta}_j(\varepsilon_{r,j}^{S})^2}{\varepsilon_{r,j}^{MS}} \,
    \text{Re}\left\{\int_{\Gamma_j}\bm{E}_n^*\cdot\bm{E}_n\,dS\right\}
```

  - *Substrate-air*:

```math
\frac{1}{Q^{SA}_j} =
    \frac{1}{\mathcal{E}^{elec}} \, \frac{1}{2} \,
    t_j\tan{\delta}_j\left(\varepsilon_{r,j}^{SA} \,
    \text{Re}\left\{\int_{\Gamma_j}\bm{E}_t^*\cdot\bm{E}_t\,dS\right\}
    + \frac{1}{\varepsilon_{r,j}^{SA}} \,
    \text{Re}\left\{\int_{\Gamma_j}\bm{E}_n^*\cdot\bm{E}_n\,dS\right\}\right)
```

where ``\bm{E}_n`` denotes the normal field to the interface and
``\bm{E}_t = \bm{E}-\bm{E}_n`` denotes the tangential field.

## Lumped parameter extraction

For electrostatic simulations, the Maxwell capacitance matrix is computed in the following
manner. First, the Laplace equation subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions is solved for
each terminal with boundary ``\Gamma_i`` in the model, yielding an associated voltage field
``V_i(\bm{x})``:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\cdot(\varepsilon_r\nabla V_i) &= 0 \,,\; \bm{x}\in\Omega \\
V_i &= 1 \,,\; \bm{x}\in\Gamma_i \\
V_i &= 0 \,,\; \bm{x}\in\Gamma_j \,,\; j\neq i \,.
\end{aligned}
```

The energy of the electric field associated with any solution is

```math
\mathcal{E}(V_i) = \frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega\varepsilon_r\bm{E}_i\cdot\bm{E}_i\,dV
```

where ``\bm{E}_i=-\nabla V_i`` is the electric field. Then, the entries of the Maxwell
capacitance matrix, ``\bm{C}``, are given by

```math
\bm{C}_{ij} = \mathcal{E}(V_i+V_j)-\frac{1}{2}(\bm{C}_{ii}+\bm{C}_{jj}) \,.
```

Magnetostatic problems for inductance matrix extraction are based on the magnetic vector
potential formulation:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\nabla\times(\mu_r^{-1}\nabla\times\bm{A}_i) &= 0 \,,\; \bm{x}\in\Omega \\
\bm{n}\times(\mu_r^{-1}\nabla\times\bm{A}_i) =
    \bm{n}\times\bm{H}_i &= \bm{J}_s^{inc} \,,\; \bm{x}\in\Gamma_i \\
\bm{n}\times(\mu_r^{-1}\nabla\times\bm{A}_i) &= 0 \,,\; \bm{x}\in\Gamma_j \,,\; j\neq i \,.
\end{aligned}
```

For each port with boundary ``\Gamma_i``, a unit source surface current ``\bm{J}_s^{inc}``
is applied, yielding an associated vector potential solution ``\bm{A}_i(\bm{x})``.
Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions ``\bm{n}\times\bm{A}_i=0`` are also imposed on
specified surfaces of the model. The magnetic field energy associated with any solution is

```math
\mathcal{E}(\bm{A}_i) = \frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega\mu_r^{-1}\bm{B}_i\cdot\bm{B}_i\,dV
```

where ``\bm{B}_i = \nabla\times\bm{A}_i`` is the magnetic flux density. Then, the entries of
the inductance matrix, ``\bm{M}``, are given by

```math
\bm{M}_{ij} = \frac{1}{I_i I_j}\mathcal{E}(\bm{A}_i+\bm{A}_j)
    - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{I_i}{I_j}\bm{M}_{ii}+\frac{I_j}{I_i}\bm{M}_{jj}\right)
```

where ``I_i`` is the excitation current for port ``i``, computed by integrating the source
surface current ``\bm{J}_s^{inc}`` over the surface of the port.

## Error estimation and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)

Error estimation is used to provide element-wise error estimates for AMR, as well as a
global error indicator used to terminate AMR iterations or provide an estimate for solution
accuracy. A Zienkiewicz–Zhu (ZZ) error estimator based on [[5]](#References) is
implemented, which measures the error in the recovered magnetic field and electric flux
density. On element ``K``, we have

```math
\eta^2_K = \eta_{m,2}^2+\eta_{e,K}^2 =
    \|\mu_r^{1/2}\bm{R}_{ND}(\mu^{-1}\bm{B})
    - (\mu_r^{-1/2}\bm{B})\|_{L^2(\Omega_K)}^2
    + \|\varepsilon_r^{-1/2}\bm{R}_{RT}(\varepsilon_r\bm{E})
    - (\varepsilon_r^{1/2}\bm{E})\|_{L^2(\Omega_K)}^2
```

where ``\bm{R}_{ND}`` and ``\bm{R}_{RT}`` are the smooth-space recovery operators which
orthogonally project their argument onto ``H(\text{curl})`` and ``H(\text{div})``,
discretized by Nédélec and Raviart-Thomas elements, respectively.
